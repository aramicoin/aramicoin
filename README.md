##History

* A 2015 International Business Times article mentions aramicoin as a potential Bitcoin successor.[7] The article notes that it "hopes to offer an alternative. By taking the foundations of Bitcoin and making some adjustments, aramicoin punishes miners who use powerful machines and work together in 'pools' to monopolise the mining market."[7]
* On July 1st, 2015, aramicoin released a wallet supporting Stealth Address transactions.[8]
* On December 13, 2015 (block 208301), aramicoin forked from Scrypt-Adaptive-N proof-of-work function to Lyra2RE as a proactive defense against emerging Scrypt-Adaptive-N capable ASICs.
* On August 10, 2016 (block 347000), aramicoin forked from Lyra2RE to Lyra2REv2 because a botnet was controlling more than 10% of the hashing power of aramicoin network.[4]
